Hello, my name is Adam.

I graduated from [Elon University](http://elon.edu) with a degree in Computer Science.
I enjoy playing games in my spare time as well as working on small personal projects.
Most of my programming experience started in Java, though Ruby and Python have become my programming languages of choice.
[Git](http://git-scm.com/) and [Github](http://github.com) are the best source control tools out there, and [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) is the only text editor that anybody should ever need.
